Scripts and more for running MythTV

Currently I use these scripts on Ubuntu 16.04/MythTV 0.29.
**THESE SCRIPTS ARE PROVIDED AS-IS. USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK!!**

**PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU EDITED THE SCRIPTS BEFORE YOU RUN THEM**: Minimum is to provide 
Parameter values, e.g. logfile names, IP addresses AND to check if all used programs are installed,
e.g. wakeonlan.
